                <p>
                    Technical lead on the Identity & Trust team within the
                    Product and Engineering department at the Guardian. The team
                    manages the authentication and identity systems at the
                    Guardian, which includes sign in, account creation, account
                    recover, and user data management.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The team is responsible for the health and performance of
                    the identity system, ensuring that it is secure, scalable,
                    and reliable. We work closely with the editorial and
                    commercial teams to provide a seamless experience for our
                    users to help them get the most out of what the Guardian
                    offers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During my time on the team, I have worked on a large scale
                    migration from our in-house legacy identity platform to a
                    hybrid model where the backend services and data store is
                    provided by a third party identity-as-a-service provider,
                    while keeping the user interfaces and interactions between
                    the reader and the Guardian in house. This work is being
                    done to modernise the identity platform, improve security
                    around reader data, and enhance the reader experience for
                    our readers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I've also helped to implement key identity standards with
                    Guardian systems which include OAuth 2.0, and OpenID
                    Connect, migrating our user facing applications away from a
                    legacy in-house non-standard authentication system to these
                    industry standards. This allows us to provide a more secure
                    and reliable authentication system for our readers, and
                    improving the developer experience for our internal teams
                    when building new applications.

                <p>
                    Edurank was the source for social media analytics in the
                    education sector. Institutions use Edurank to view their
                    social activity as well as their competitorsâ€™ to benchmark
                    themselves against the sector. The paid for Enterprise SaaS
                    version allows institutions to get a deep dive into their
                    data by comparing their social media metrics down to an
                    hours granularity against any number of competitors and
                    sectors.

                    The client side uses Angular JS to build the application
                    which connects to an API server built using Express.js with
                    a MongoDB database. I am the lead software developer on
                    Edurank, and worked on the full stack, developing much of
                    the client and server side, as well as any backend

                    Akero is used by education marketers to convert more student
                    enquires into enrollments. A unique combination of features
                    that creates the perfect advertising infrastructure. So we
                    can track and report on all the data that matters, from
                    impressions to the individual whilst improving conversions
                    through personalisation and A/B testing.

                    One of the main components I&apos;ve contributed to the
                    product is a &ldquo;Social Performance Analytic&rdquo;
                    feature, allowing our users to compare social media
                    statistics from Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube
                    for themselves and their competitors.
