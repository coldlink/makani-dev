                <p>
                    Edurank is the source for social media analytics in the
                    education sector. Institutions use Edurank to view their
                    social activity as well as their competitors’ to benchmark
                    themselves against the sector. The paid for Enterprise SaaS
                    version allows institutions to get a deep dive into their
                    data by comparing their social media metrics down to an
                    hours granularity against any number of competitors and
                    sectors.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The client side uses Angular JS to build the application
                    which connects to an API server built using Express.js with
                    a MongoDB database. I am the lead software developer on
                    Edurank, and worked on the full stack, developing much of
                    the client and server side, as well as any backend
                    applications such as workers and databases.

                    Akero is used by education marketers to convert more student

                    that creates the perfect advertising infrastructure. So we
                    can track and report on all the data that matters, from
                    impressions to the individual whilst improving conversions
                    through personalisation and A/B testing.
