The main reason for my visit to Bempton Cliffs was to see the puffins. However, we were almost disappointed when we were told that they hadn't been spotted yet.

We did however see a variety of other seabirds, including gannets, razorbills, and guillemots. All of which were amazing as the were flying and clinging to the cliffs. The views of the cliffs themselves and the sea were stunning, and we had a great time exploring the area. In the end, we were in luck, we initially spotted a puffin bobbing in the water, followed by learning how to spot them in flight thanks to an RSPB volunteer. Eventually, we even saw a few puffins on the cliffs themselves!

It was a fantastic day out, the highlight of our visit to Yorkshire, and I do recommend visiting Bempton Cliffs, especially in the late spring/early summer when the birds are here.
