A scenic circular 15km walk in the Chiltern Hills, exploring the northern part
of Ashridge Estate taking in the spectacular views from Ivinghoe Beacon, Incombe
Hole, Pitstone Hill, and passing through the charming village of Aldbury.

For alternate walks in the area, check out the
[National Trust Ashridge Estate](https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/visit/essex-bedfordshire-hertfordshire/ashridge-estate)
page, and find the "Top Trails" section under the "Things to see and do" tab.

## Introduction

The walk took me about 4 hours to complete, but this included stopping for
photos, a coffee and cake break, and a picnic lunch. Most of the walk is on
public footpaths and bridleways, but some small sections are on permissive
paths, as these are typically National Trust paths.

I started this walk at the
["Ivinghoe Beacon Circular Walk Car Park"](https://maps.app.goo.gl/dekkHgiD3yehqhD46),
but it's possible to start of at any number of car parks along the route, for
example the
["Pitstone Hill Car Park"](https://maps.app.goo.gl/1ipK4RJXAUmjCnjF7), the
["National Trust Ashridge Estate Car Park"](https://maps.app.goo.gl/K5nYLKWV7HQaiVfbA),
or the ["Ling Ride Car Park"](https://maps.app.goo.gl/5hvmZzkrTZXvhXRB7) and
adjust the route depending on where you start from.

It's also accessible by public transport, with the nearest train station being
[Tring](https://maps.app.goo.gl/APfr1ZYodK9C1b3X6), which is only 500m from part
of the route between Aldbury Nowers and Aldbury.

I will mention various car parks and public transport options along the way.

If you have any questions or suggestions about the route, please feel free to
reach out to me through the [contact page](/contact).

## Steps Hill and Incombe Hole

From the
["Ivinghoe Beacon Circular Walk Car Park"](https://maps.app.goo.gl/dekkHgiD3yehqhD46),
I followed the path next to the road leading towards the beacon to join up with
the Ridgeway National Trail, where you'll find the following signpost. Since I
finished the walk at Ivinghoe Beacon, I started the walk by heading the other
way on the Rigdeway.

<!-- deno-fmt-ignore -->
::photo{alt="A signpost near the start of the walk, we'll be following the Ridgeway National Trail for a short while, away from Ivinghoe Beacon." src="20250523-_87A9615-Enhanced-NR.jpg"}

Not too long after starting the walk, I ended up at the top of Steps Hill, with
the first of many vista points of the day. Steps Hill has permissive access, so
I decided to do a short circular walk around the top of the hill, which isn't
marked on the map above, but is a nice little detour to take.

Below Steps Hill is Incombe Hole, a chalkland dry valley, which apparently is a
great place to
[observe butterflies](https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/visit/essex-bedfordshire-hertfordshire/ashridge-estate/ivinghoe-hills-butterfly-walk),
but I wasn't paying enough attention to be able to observe any.

<!-- deno-fmt-ignore -->
::photo{alt="Panorama from Steps Hill looking over Incombe Hole in the foreground. Pitstone Hill can be seen in the background, with the path leading to it to the left." src="20250523-_87A9400-Pano.jpg" resolution="panorama"}

I carried on following the Ridgeway from Steps Hill towards Pitstone Hill, where
along the way I passed through a grassland area where all I could hear was the
sound of Eurasian Skylarks singing, and a Corn Bunting perched on a tree.

As someone who enjoys [bird photography](/photos), I was a bit disappointed that
I didn't have my telephoto lens with me, mostly due to the weight, but I also
wasn't expecting to see too many birds on this walk. I did use my 50mm lens to
take a photo of the Corn Bunting, which can be seen below, which I'm relatively
pleased with.

<!-- deno-fmt-ignore -->
::photo{alt="A Corn Bunting perched on top of a tree. I wish I'd bought my telephoto lens." src="20250523-_87A9407-Enhanced-NR.jpg"}

## Pitstone Hill and Aldbury Nowers

Leaving the grassland area, I crossed over Stocks Road, and ended up at the
["Pitstone Hill Car Park"](https://maps.app.goo.gl/1ipK4RJXAUmjCnjF7), which
would also be a good place to start the walk from. Pitstone Hill is right next
to the car park too.

I decided to take the permissive path up to the top of Pitstone Hill, to enjoy
the views from the top, which is a great place to look back over to Steps Hill
and Ivinghoe Beacon.

<!-- deno-fmt-ignore -->
::photo{alt="A view from Pitstone Hill looking towards Steps Hill, and Ivinghoe Beacon to the left in the distance." src="20250523-_87A9422-Pano.jpg" resolution="panorama"}

I also spotted the
[Pitstone Windmill](https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/visit/oxfordshire-buckinghamshire-berkshire/pitstone-windmill),
which is one of the oldest post mills in Britain, dating back to at least the
17th century. If you want a longer walk, it's a slight detour to visit the mill.

In the distance, I noticed a castle/tower like building, which I later found out
was [Mentmore Towers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mentmore_Towers), which is
currently under private ownership has been relatively neglected, and on the
["Heritage at Risk Register"](https://historicengland.org.uk/listing/heritage-at-risk/search-register/list-entry/49785).

The view of the village of Pitstone is quite nice too, and also seeing the
village of Cheddington peeking out from behind the trees.

<!-- deno-fmt-ignore -->
::photo{alt="Looking down from Pitstone Hill looking down towards the Pitstone Windmill, the village of Pitstone, and Mentmore Towers in the distance." src="20250523-_87A9427-Enhanced-NR.jpg"}

Carrying on from Pitstone Hill and following the Ridgeway, I saw on the map that
the path followed the route of
[Grim's Ditch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grim%27s_Ditch_(Chilterns)), an
ancient earthwork that dates back to the Iron Age, the purpose of which is still
debated. It is one of many
[Grim's Ditches across England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grim%27s_Ditch).

<!-- deno-fmt-ignore -->
::photo{alt="A path between Pitstone Hill and Aldbury Nowers, following the route of Grim's Ditch." src="20250523-_87A9441-Enhanced-NR.jpg"}

Following the path soon leads into
[Aldbury Nowers](https://www.hertswildlifetrust.org.uk/nature-reserves/aldbury-nowers),
a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) managed by the Hertfordshire and
Middlesex Wildlife Trust, which again is a great place to spot butterflies, and
has a variety of flora and fauna, but yet again I wasn't paying enough attention
to spot anything. The walk through the ancient woodlands following a section fo
the Grim's Ditch is quite nice though.

<!-- deno-fmt-ignore -->
::photo{alt="The path through the woods on Aldbury Nowers, again following the route of Grim's Ditch." src="20250523-_87A9447-Enhanced-NR.jpg"}

After passing through Albury Nowers, I started to head towards the direction of
Albury and leave the Ridgeway behind. The signpost below was very helpful, as it
wasn't immediately obvious which way to go.

This is the point that's also closest to
[Tring Station](https://maps.app.goo.gl/APfr1ZYodK9C1b3X6), so a good place to
start the walk if coming via public transport.

<!-- deno-fmt-ignore -->
::photo{alt="A signpost showing that we're now leaving the Ridgeway and following the path towards Aldbury. The sign for Ridgeway opposite to the Aldbury one leads directly to Tring Station." src="20250523-_87A9454-Enhanced-NR.jpg"}

## Aldbury

The way to Aldbury passes by a few farm fields, and is extremely narrow for a
bridleway and full of overgrown wild plants, so I was glad that I didn't come
across any cyclists or other walkers on this section. I did check myself for
ticks after this section though, but didn't find any, thankfully. The view from
the path leading into Aldbury is nice, with the village church a useful landmark
to use to navigate towards the village.

There are a number of paths in this area that lead to Aldbury, so you don't have
to stick to the one I suggest, and it's difficult to get lost as a result of
this.

<!-- deno-fmt-ignore -->
::photo{alt="The narrow bridleway leading into Aldbury, with the village church in the distance." src="20250523-_87A9457-Enhanced-NR.jpg"}

The path leads you past Church Farm, where I noticed a sign for
["Church Farm Cafe"](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Q78ZJV93o4XbdVaCA), which in
hindsight looks rather lovely for a stop, but I'd already planned to at the
National Trust cafe at Ashridge Estate instead, so I walked past.

At Station Road, I turned left and headed towards the village centre, where I
found the small village green. From there I spied a pub,
[The Greyhound](https://maps.app.goo.gl/VfVeAgoywopWbymK7), which could serve as
a good place to stop for a drink too, the small duck pond (with ducks! and a
duck house!), and the old stocks and whipping post, which are preserved in the
village centre.

<!-- deno-fmt-ignore -->
::photo{alt="The village centre of Aldbury looking towards the pub, The Greyhound. Probably too many cars for my liking. The duck pond is nice though." src="20250523-_87A9459-Enhanced-NR.jpg"}

<!-- deno-fmt-ignore -->
::photo{alt="The old stocks and whipping post preserved in the Aldbury village centre." src="20250523-_87A9461-Enhanced-NR.jpg"}

I should've probably spent more time in Aldbury, but instead here's the
[Wikipedia page for Aldbury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aldbury) instead.

I walked through past the village centre, and headed up Toms Hill Road. Not long
after is the public bridleway that leads to the Ashridge Estate. The sign for
which was a bit hidden, but I spotted it just in time.

## Ashridge Estate and the Bridgewater Monument

The bridleway towards the Ashridge Estate and Bridgewater Monument becomes quite
steep, going from around 135m above sea level at the Aldbury village centre to
around 220m above sea level by the National Trust Visitor Centre.

The estate is quite large, and has a number of different paths and trails to
explore, so I recommend checking out the
[National Trust Ashridge Estate](https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/visit/essex-bedfordshire-hertfordshire/ashridge-estate)
page for more information about those, especially if you want to spend more time
in the estate itself.

If you visit in late April to early May, you'll be able to see the bluebells in
the woods, which are quite spectacular. I visited a bit too late in the season
for that and only managed to spot the last dregs of the bluebells, but the
woodland paths were still lovely to walk through.

<!-- deno-fmt-ignore -->
::photo{alt="A signpost showing the numerous options for exploring the Ashridge Estate." src="20250523-_87A9463-Enhanced-NR.jpg"}

Having visited the Ashridge Estate a few times before, I not to spend too much
time at the Bridgewater Monument, but if you'd like to know more about it, you
can read the
[Wikipedia page for the Bridgewater Monument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridgewater_Monument).
The tl;dr is that it was built in 1832 to commemorate Francis Egerton, 3rd Duke
of Bridgewater, known as the "Canal Duke" dur to his role in the development of
the canal system and inland navigation in England. You can climb to the top of
the monument, but I didn't do that on this visit, though maybe I should've done
as it's free for National Trust members. There's always next time!

<!-- deno-fmt-ignore -->
::photo{alt="The Bridgewater Monument, a 32m tall tower built in 1832 to commemorate Francis Egerton, 3rd Duke of Bridgewater. I don't know who that is, but he apparently built canals." src="20250523-_87A9466-Enhanced-NR.jpg"}

Instead I beelined to the cafe at the National Trust Visitor Centre as I noticed
that it was quiet and there was no queue, so I spent some time enjoying a coffee
and a slice of apple and blueberry flapjack, which was delicious! I spent some
time in the shop and bookshop too, which has a good selection of books and
trinkets, but I didn't buy anything this time.

This is also the point of the
["National Trust Ashridge Estate Car Park"](https://maps.app.goo.gl/K5nYLKWV7HQaiVfbA),
which is free for all, but locked between 10pm and 6am. It's probably the most
central car park for the Ashridge Estate, and a good place to start a number of
walks in the area.

<!-- deno-fmt-ignore -->
::photo{alt="The National Trust Ashridge Estate Visitor Centre, a great place to stop for a coffee, cake, knowledge, and trinkets!" src="20250523-_87A9469-Enhanced-NR.jpg"}

After my coffee break, I headed past Monument Drive, following the public
footpath relatively to the north, towards Beacon Road, and the Ling Ride Car
Park.

Walking through the woods I spooked (and was also spooked by) both a deer and a
buzzard, which was a lovely surprise, but I didn't manage to get a photo of
either.

I did however take an ASMR-esque video of the woodland walk, which you can watch
below. Despite the area around the Visitor Centre being quite busy, the woodland
paths were relatively quiet, and I didn't come across anyone else on this
section of the walk.

<!-- deno-fmt-ignore -->
::youtube{id="zScK1NkkfFU" alt="The woodland path in the Ashridge Estate heading towards the northern part of the estate and the Ling Ride Car Park."}

I did get slightly lost on the way to the
["Ling Ride Car Park"](https://maps.app.goo.gl/5hvmZzkrTZXvhXRB7), as I missed a
turning, but I ended up on the right path eventually. From the Ling Ride Car
Park I crossed Beacon Road and followed signs for the "Ashridge Estate Boundary
Trail" for the next section of the walk.

## Northern Ashridge Estate and The Coombe

Right after crossing Beacon Road, I spotted a couple of cats in the garden of a
house next to the footpath. I should remember to carry some cat treats for
situations like this.

<!-- deno-fmt-ignore -->
::photo{alt="I spotted two cats in the garden of a house just across the road from the Ling Ride Car Park on the public footpath! Unfortunately, they didn't want to come and say hello." src="20250523-_87A9476-Enhanced-NR.jpg"}

There isn't much to say about the next section of the walk, other than it
follows along side and through a number of farms and fields. Often at times with
sheep and lambs grazing in the fields, so watch out for the poop!

<!-- deno-fmt-ignore -->
::photo{alt="Lots of sheep grazing. Watch out for the sheep shit on the public footpaths." src="20250523-_87A9481-Enhanced-NR.jpg"}

Eventually I made my way through Ward Hurst's Farm, just after which I got the
first sighting of the Whipsnade White Lion hill figure and the Dunstable Downs.
Speaking of which I highly recommend visiting the
[Dunstable Downs](https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/visit/essex-bedfordshire-hertfordshire/dunstable-downs-and-whipsnade-estate)
too, where a walk will also take you to the
[Whipsnade Tree Cathedral](https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/visit/essex-bedfordshire-hertfordshire/whipsnade-tree-cathedral),
made from trees, shrubs and plants, was created after the First World War in the
spirit of 'faith, hope and reconciliation'. I'll try and remember to do another
post on that should I visit there again!

<!-- deno-fmt-ignore -->
::photo{alt="Spotting the Whipsnade White Lion, next to Whipsnade Zoo. Also the Dunstable Downs, which I'll have to do another post on." src="20250523-_87A9497-Enhanced-NR.jpg"}

Right after the farm, I entered a wooded area called "The Coombe", with a
distinct smell of wild garlic in the air, which as a self proclaimed garlic
lover, is one of the best smells in the world.

This area is quite steep, dropping from around 230m to around 170m above sea
level, but thankfully the path is well maintained and there is a rope handrail
to help you down the steepest sections.

<!-- deno-fmt-ignore -->
::photo{alt="Endless wild garlic just as you enter The Coombe." src="20250523-_87A9498-Enhanced-NR.jpg"}

As I walked through The Coombe, I suddenly noticed a change in the atmosphere
and the flora, as the dense ground flora was suddenly replaced with nothing, and
lots of tall aligned trees. This is Mead's Plantation, which a signpost informed
me is a plantation of non-native western red cedar trees, which explains the
lack of ground flora and wildlife due to the dense canopy blocking out the
light. However the sign also went on to say that this is the habitat of one of
the UK's smallest birds, the
[firecrest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_firecrest), but I didn't manage
to spot or hear one on this visit.

<!-- deno-fmt-ignore -->
::youtube{id="kJENlbIWzhQ" alt="A video showing the sudden transition in vibes when walking into Mead's Plantation."}

<!-- deno-fmt-ignore -->
::photo{alt="Mead's Plantation. Full of dense, non-native western red cedar trees, hence the lack of ground flora. Apparently the firecrest can be found here, though I didn't catch a sight or even sound of one through." src="20250523-_87A9509-Enhanced-NR.jpg"}

After walking through Mead's Plantation, I ended up back in "normal" woodlands.
Eventually the woodlands gave way to an open area with a view of Ivinghoe Beacon
again.

## Ivinghoe Beacon

There are a couple of paths here which lead directly to Ivinghoe Beacon, but I
took the path to the right, again following the signs for the "Ashridge Estate
Boundary Trail".

<!-- deno-fmt-ignore -->
::photo{alt="As we leave The Coombe we spot Ivinghoe Beacon again, we'll carry on following the path to the right" src="20250523-_87A9517-Enhanced-NR.jpg"}

While walking along the footpath, I spotted a glider being towed up by a plane.
There were also a number of Red Kites around too. There isn't much else to say
about this area, probably because I was getting quiet hungry and wanted to have
a picnic lunch at the top of Ivinghoe Beacon.

<!-- deno-fmt-ignore -->
::photo{alt="A glider being towed up by a plane above Gallows Hill, on which a couple of walkers can be seen." src="20250523-_87A9525-Enhanced-NR.jpg"}

The climb up to Gallows Hill and Ivinghoe Beacon wasn't actually too bad, apart
from the first 20m or so, the rest of the path is not too bad. I won't spoil the
views from the top, but I will say that it's well worth the climb, and you can
see for miles around.

<!-- deno-fmt-ignore -->
::photo{alt="Panorama of Gallows Hill and Beacon Hill, with the path leading up the hill to the right." src="20250523-_87A9530-Pano.jpg" resolution="panorama"}

It was quite a bit windy at the top, but still a lovely place just to sit and
take in the views. The sandwich I'd bought with me was very much appreciated at
this point. I also found out that the beacon is a popular
[filming location](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivinghoe_Beacon#Filming_location),
as it has an appearance of remoteness despite being close to a number of film
studios.

I did attempt to take a full 360° panorama from the top, but it didn't turn out
as well as I hoped for, so I won't include it here.

<!-- deno-fmt-ignore -->
::photo{alt="Spying the trig point and sign on Ivinghoe Beacon." src="20250523-_87A9545-Enhanced-NR.jpg"}

While I was sitting at the top, I noticed a number of small gliders and planes
flying around, which I worked out belonged to a number radio-controlled model
aircraft enthusiasts who were flying their gliders at the top of Ivinghoe
Beacon.

According to the
[Atlas Obscura](https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ivinghoe-beacon) page for
Ivinghoe Beacon, this is a popular spot for this activity, also known as "slope
soaring", which is due to the uphill winds created by the hill.

I don't think they minded me taking a number of photos of them, which turned out
rather nice.

<!-- deno-fmt-ignore -->
::photo{alt="A group of hobbyists flying radio-controlled model aircraft gliders." src="20250523-_87A9594-Enhanced-NR.jpg"}

This one in particular was my favourite, as it shows the model aircraft
enthusiast launching their glider into the air and just after take off. I took a
burst of images, and combined them into a single photo showing the launch and
flight of the glider.

<!-- deno-fmt-ignore -->
::photo{alt="A 3 photo composite showing a model aircraft enthusiast launching their glider." src="20250523-_87A9602-Enhanced-NR-Edit.jpg"}

After spending some time at the top of Ivinghoe Beacon, I decided to head back
down the hill, following the start of the Ridgeway National Trail back towards
the car park I started from.

Finally, all I can say that this is a lovely walk, and I can highly recommend it
as it's relatively accessible from a number of car parks and public transport
options, and has a variety of scenery and wildlife to enjoy. I hope you enjoyed
this post, and if you have any questions or suggestions about the route, please
feel free to reach out to me through the [contact page](/contact).
